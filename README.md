### Well, what HAVE I done?
* [Did I mess up Wikipedia? It's up to you to decide.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:contribs/weeklyd3)
* [Malware I've contributed](https://stackoverflow.com/users/15578194/?tab=answers)

### Some things I noticed about this site:
1. GitHub inserted that level 2 heading above
2. This is from weeklyd3/weeklyd3
3. Not weeklydÐ—/weeklydÐ—
4. GitHub uses CodeMirror
5. That number 3 was a 3 not a Ð—
6. 1Ð— + 1Ð— + 1Ð— = Ð—9
7. 1Ð±Ð±Ñ‡ + 1Ð±Ð±Ñ‡ = Ð·Ð·28

### Stuff about Wikipedia in particular:
1. [Don't be a rouge admin like this guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2007-04-23/Robdurbar)
2. [Yes, I spelled 'rouge' correctly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:ROUGE)
3. [Don't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Permalink/124047566) [vandalize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Permalink/124047960) [the main page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Permalink/124048662), or [this](https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&type=rights&user=&page=User%3ARobdurbar%40enwiki) will happen to you
4. Don't even try to write an article about any random user like me, or it'll end up at [WP:AfD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:AfD).
5. Or it'll become a [bad article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:April_Fools/April_Fools%27_Day_2021/Bad_articles) or even a [horrible article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Horrible_Articles). Who knows?

### Some things about you (yes, you):
1. You had a browser open to GitHub at some point.
2. The URL you are currently on has `weeklyd3` in it.
3. You are either using a screenreader, looking at a screen, or looking at another copy of this.
4. You should not [click here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:BEANS/Uh-huh), because clicking on it will blow up Wikipedia.
5. You probably clicked the link above.
6. Do not read the next list entry
7. Do not read the **previous** list entry because you read this one
8. Do not scroll down either.
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
Just, don't.
